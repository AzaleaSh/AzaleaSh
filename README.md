Hi, Iâ€™m AzaleaSh, I use She/Her pronouns.

I am a graduating senior at Sycamore High School and an upcoming freshman at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign at Granger Engineering. I am very interested in Astrophysics so of course my GitHub models it.

My Github acts as my personal library, which is essentially a storage of projects that I have made over time.

I can be contacted at azaleahazel@gmail.com

Shoot for the stars!
